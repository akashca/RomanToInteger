I have added all the symbol and value(for all 7 roman symbols)
initializing result
I used a for loop to check the next character in the Roman number string to see if the number is associated with the numeral should be subtracted or added to the total.
Then we compare both
If the previous value is greater or equal to the next value then we will add else we subtract
Here i am taking string from user
